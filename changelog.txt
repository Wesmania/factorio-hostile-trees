Version: 0.3.0
Date: 19/04/2025

  Changes:
    - Now that I beat Space Age, it's time to update the mod for 2.0.
    - The absolute bare minimum was done to get the mod to start a new game.
      Things might still be broken and crash for 2.0 vanilla, and will
      definitely be broken in weird ways in Space Age.
    - Still, that's better than nothing and I hope to fix things soon. Enjoy,
      and please report bugs.
