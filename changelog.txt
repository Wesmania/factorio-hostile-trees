  Changes:
    - More mod fixes. 0.3.0 was still badly broken , this one shouldn't be.
    - Tested on my Space Age save, all crashes within the first few minutes
      were fixed and some other stuff was explicitly tested. Please report bugs.
    - Trees on Gleba also hate you now. We are ecstatic to make your Gleba
      experience even more enjoyable.
      - For the squeamish, Gleba hatred can be disabled. I hate you, you're the
	only reason I couldn't keep this a surprise.

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 19/04/2025

  Changes:
    - Now that I beat Space Age, it's time to update the mod for 2.0.
    - The absolute bare minimum was done to get the mod to start a new game.
      Things might still be broken and crash for 2.0 vanilla, and will
      definitely be broken in weird ways in Space Age.
    - Still, that's better than nothing and I hope to fix things soon. Enjoy,
      and please report bugs.
